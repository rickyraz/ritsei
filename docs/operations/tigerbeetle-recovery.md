## 1. TigerBeetle documentation findings

The official documentation is the source of truth for provider semantics:

- [System Architecture](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/system-architecture) places TigerBeetle
  in the data plane and the general-purpose database in the control plane. The application follows
  this split.
- [Reliable Transaction Submission](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/reliable-transaction-submission)
  requires a client-generated, persisted transfer ID and retrying the same ID.
  `financial_operation_transfers.engine_transfer_id` is persisted before the first submission
  attempt; retry and reconciliation reuse it.
- [Requests](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/requests) says create events are idempotent: a
  replay receives `exists`, not a second object.
- [Data Modeling](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/data-modeling) assigns transfers, balances,
  double-entry constraints, and strict serializability to TigerBeetle. Ledger metadata and
  application account mappings remain in PostgreSQL.
- [Safety](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/concepts/safety) describes immutable, checksummed,
  hash-chained data and safe shutdown when quorum/durability cannot be preserved. The application
  therefore never converts an unavailable or unknown provider result into a PostgreSQL posting.
- [Debits and credits](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/data-modeling#debits-vs-credits) requires
  the application to interpret the debit/credit balance convention. Account provisioning maps
  asset/expense accounts to `credits_must_not_exceed_debits` and liability/equity/revenue accounts
  to `debits_must_not_exceed_credits`.
- [Cluster Recommendations](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/cluster) recommends six replicas
  for production and states that durability is preserved only while the cluster remains safely
  available. The local one-replica cluster is test-only.
- [Deploying](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/deploying) reserves cluster ID `0` for testing
  and recommends a supervisor and six dedicated production replicas. Production configuration must
  not reuse the local `0_0.tigerbeetle` setup.
- [Recovering](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/recovering) explicitly says not to use
  `tigerbeetle format` for a permanently lost replica. Use `tigerbeetle recover` against a healthy
  cluster, then let state sync repair the new replica. No repository script may format or replace a
  replica by guessing.
- [Monitoring](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/monitoring) requires alerting on non-normal
  replica status and state sync, and recommends measuring client-side request latency in addition to
  replica request timing.
- [Change Data Capture](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/cdc) can stream transfers and balance
  updates through AMQP. CDC is an observation/rebuild input, not a second authority; its resume
  timestamp must be persisted by the operator if it is enabled.

The current official operating index documents replica recovery but does not provide a generic
application-level PostgreSQL/TigerBeetle snapshot transaction or a magic cross-store backup point.
Therefore an independently restored pair is fenced until the application recovery watermark is
verified.

## 2. Authority map

| Fact                                                                | Authority                | PostgreSQL representation                       | Rebuild/recovery rule                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepted transfer, amount, accounts, ledger, code, flags, timestamp | TigerBeetle              | `financial_operation_transfers` identity/status | Lookup the same transfer ID; never edit/delete it                   |
| Account posted/pending totals                                       | TigerBeetle              | Balance reads/projections                       | Re-read from TigerBeetle; no PostgreSQL balance authority           |
| Tenant, Legal Entity, account metadata, currency policy             | PostgreSQL               | Accounting control-plane tables                 | Required metadata for rebuilding a report                           |
| Financial intent and operation identity                             | PostgreSQL               | `financial_operations`                          | Stable operation ID and transfer IDs are immutable                  |
| Journal lines and references                                        | PostgreSQL               | `journal_entries`, `journal_lines`              | Metadata projection; accepted amounts must reconcile to TigerBeetle |
| Posted/reconciled status                                            | PostgreSQL control state | Operation/journal/transfer statuses             | Rebuild only after exact TigerBeetle identity verification          |
| Outbox/event delivery                                               | PostgreSQL               | Messaging outbox                                | Reappend the same event identity/idempotency key                    |
| Cutover approval and watermark                                      | PostgreSQL               | `financial_cutover_controls`                    | Activation is scoped and auditable; no config-only activation       |

A PostgreSQL row is not evidence that TigerBeetle accepted a transfer. An accepted TigerBeetle
transfer is not evidence that the PostgreSQL projection is complete until the operation is
`reconciled`.

## 3. Lifecycle and failure matrix

The executable matrix is also exported as `packages/accounting/src/financial-readiness.ts` and
tested by `packages/accounting/tests/financial-readiness.test.ts`. Accounting failpoints
(`makeFinancialOperationFailpointLayer`) cover the PostgreSQL/engine crash windows, provider faults
cover unknown/unavailable responses, and worker failpoints cover lease/restart/stale-completion
behavior. The PostgreSQL test `financial-operations.postgres.test.ts` executes the recovery retries
for these boundaries; it is failure-injection evidence, not a proof of OS kill or quorum.

## 4. Historical boundary and opening balance

The current migration policy is **opening-balance cutover**, not an unproven historical replay:

1. Preserve all legacy PostgreSQL journals as historical control-plane data.
2. Keep their `financial_operations.engine_verified` value false unless an exact TigerBeetle
   transfer identity can be proven.
3. Freeze the selected tenant/Legal Entity boundary and record a cutover watermark in
   `financial_cutover_controls`.
4. Produce one account-level opening-balance report for every account/currency mapping.
5. Create/import opening balances in the approved TigerBeetle procedure.
6. Compare exact integer debit and credit totals at account, currency, Legal Entity, and
   mapping-version level.
7. Abort approval on any missing, duplicate, mapping, currency, or amount discrepancy.

`verifyOpeningBalances` performs the exact account-level comparison used by the rehearsal. It
applies no tolerance. A global total match is insufficient. `buildFinancialVerificationEvidence`
additionally hashes operation, balance, transfer, and projection sets and records mismatch counts
for a bounded cohort. Full historical replay remains an optional future migration and cannot be used
to mark existing PostgreSQL rows as TigerBeetle facts.

## 5. Controlled activation

Normal configuration accepts only PostgreSQL. TigerBeetle activation uses the Accounting service
commands and the database state machine:

```text
postgresql
  -> preparing_tigerbeetle
  -> verification_pending / approved
  -> activating
  -> tigerbeetle
```

The controlled sequence is:

1. Authorized operator calls `prepareTigerBeetleCutover`.
2. A dry-run opening-balance/historical report records its watermark and hash.
3. Recovery/backup and reconciliation rehearsals are recorded as immutable, hash-bound
   `financial_verification_artifacts` rows. A production signer must provide an Ed25519 signature
   and externally managed key ID; the default API layer intentionally has no signer and cannot
   approve activation.
4. Authorized operator calls `approveTigerBeetleCutover` with the verified `evidenceArtifactId`; the
   service derives the four gate flags from that artifact and rejects caller-supplied readiness
   booleans.
5. `activateTigerBeetleCutover` provisions every mapped account idempotently, verifies account
   metadata and balance constraints, then changes the route and cutover control in one PostgreSQL
   transaction.
6. The database trigger rejects direct PostgreSQL-to-TigerBeetle route changes unless the durable
   control is `activating`.
7. Legacy PostgreSQL posting remains fenced after activation. There is no catch-and-fallback path.

The current compatibility boundary is tenant-wide for the legacy `postJournal` API, because that API
has no Legal Entity argument. A production pilot must therefore use a tenant cohort with a
non-overlapping financial boundary, or first migrate that API to an explicit Legal Entity command.

## 6. Recovery procedures

### TigerBeetle outage

- Stop accepting new TigerBeetle financial work after the bounded retry budget is reached.
- Keep intents/jobs durable as `submitted` or `unknown`.
- Do not post the same operation to PostgreSQL.
- After cluster health is normal, lookup the original transfer IDs and resume reconciliation.

### PostgreSQL outage

- Treat TigerBeetle acceptance as authoritative but incomplete from the application perspective.
- On PostgreSQL recovery, resume the operation/job with the original identity.
- Reconcile before allowing dependent financial work.

### Worker or adapter crash

- Let the Process lease expire or use lease fencing.
- The next worker reads the durable operation state.
- `intent/submitted` submits using persisted IDs; `unknown/accepted` reconciles.
- A new transfer identity is never generated for recovery.

### Lost response

- A timeout or network error is `unknown`, not `not_found`.
- Only a successful exact lookup returning no matching transfer IDs proves `not_found`.
- A partial result, wrong metadata, wrong mapping version, or conflicting ID is manual recovery.

### Replica failure

- Preserve the cluster configuration and all replica indexes.
- Never run `tigerbeetle format` on a lost production replica.
- Confirm the cluster is healthy and can view-change.
- Run the version-matched `tigerbeetle recover` command for the lost replica, then start it normally
  and wait for state sync.
- Alert on non-normal `replica_status` and `state_sync_stage` until normal.

### Cross-store restore

1. Freeze submission and record the PostgreSQL operation watermark.
2. Record the TigerBeetle observation/CDC timestamp if CDC is enabled.
3. Restore each store using its supported procedure; do not assume the backups share a commit point.
4. Compare every accepted operation and transfer identity through the watermark, plus account
   metadata and exact balances.
5. Quarantine missing receipts, orphan transfers, conflicting identities, and projection gaps.
6. Rebuild only derived PostgreSQL projections after the comparison succeeds.
7. Keep posting disabled until an authorized operator records the verification hash and recovery
   watermark.

No restore procedure deletes, edits, or reassigns an accepted TigerBeetle transfer. Recovery is
forward-only through reconciliation, correction/reversal, or explicit manual recovery.

## 7. Rehearsal evidence and monitoring

A successful bounded reconciliation writes an immutable `financial_reconciliation_checkpoints` row
with source/target snapshot refs, operation/balance/transfer/projection hashes, recovery watermark,
mismatch count, and orphan count. Unexpected transfer identities are inserted into
`financial_orphan_transfers` and block the checkpoint. The current port scans known operation
transfer IDs; it does not yet provide a TigerBeetle CDC/global transfer cursor, so an
operation-scoped checkpoint is not global orphan-scan or point-in-time completeness evidence.

A signed evidence artifact is accepted only when its canonical evidence hash is signed by the
configured Ed25519 signer. The test signer is ephemeral and is not production key-management
evidence. Production must supply a custody-approved `FinancialVerificationSigner` layer. The
current TigerBeetle readiness gate requires KMS/HSM or an explicitly approved equivalent custody
profile. Retain the public-key resolution record and verify the signature during release review.

Latest local evidence (2026-08-19): the official TigerBeetle binary `0.17.9+cc1c06a` passed the
scoped one-replica integration test, including the exact `500,000,000,000,000.00` amount boundary,
linked accepted journal, deterministic replay path, balance read, U128 overflow rejection, and
account-constraint rejection. Repository validation passed with 207 tests and 1 intentional skip. This is adapter and database evidence only; it is not quorum, production outage,
backup/restore, or cutover evidence.

Safe automated evidence:

```sh
deno task test packages/accounting/tests/financial-readiness.test.ts
deno task test packages/accounting/tests/financial-ledger.test.ts
deno task test packages/kernel/tests/tigerbeetle.test.ts
deno task test apps/worker/worker.test.ts
```

PostgreSQL rehearsals must use `withTemporaryDatabase` and never a production URL. The live
integration test remains gated by `TIGERBEETLE_INTEGRATION=1`. A local single-replica cluster proves
client integration only; it does not prove production quorum, backup, or restore readiness.

The following must be exposed by the deployment metrics/logging layer before approval:

- submitted backlog and queue age;
- accepted-but-not-reconciled count and age;
- submission/reconciliation latency;
- duplicate and unknown outcomes;
- TigerBeetle unavailable responses;
- projection failures and manual-recovery count;
- cutover status, owner, watermark, and engine ownership;
- TigerBeetle replica status, state-sync status, disk space, and client latency.

Logs must contain operation IDs, stable reason tags, and correlation IDs, but not credentials or
unnecessary financial payloads.

### Required operational gate evidence

Each staging rehearsal must produce one immutable evidence record containing the gate ID, cohort,
operator, deployment versions, PostgreSQL and TigerBeetle endpoints, operation IDs, transfer IDs,
lease generations, recovery watermark, timestamps, and the final reconciliation result. The record
must prove the behavior, not only that a command returned zero.

| Gate | Rehearsal | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process kill after acceptance | Kill worker A after provider acceptance and before receipt; start worker B | One accepted transfer set, one receipt, same deterministic IDs, no duplicate projection |
| Lease expiry | Let worker A's lease expire; let worker B reclaim the job | Worker A completion is rejected; worker B's higher generation completes |
| Provider outage | Stop or isolate the provider during submission, then restore it | PostgreSQL remains `submitted`/`unknown`; retry uses the same IDs; no fallback posting |
| Independent restore | Restore PostgreSQL and TigerBeetle backups into isolated endpoints | Posting remains fenced until watermark, balances, transfers, and projections match exactly |
| Global reconciliation | Compare provider transfer inventory, balances, and PostgreSQL mappings | No unexplained orphan, duplicate, mapping, amount, or projection mismatch |
| Operator alerts | Exercise outage, lag, unknown outcome, and manual recovery paths | Alerts fire with operation ID, reason tag, scope, severity, and recovery owner |

The repository tests prove deterministic adapter and database behavior. They do not upgrade a local
single-replica or test-adapter result into staging-real evidence. The release gate remains `NO-GO`
until the operational records above are collected from the supported deployment topology.

## 8. Executed readiness rehearsal — August 18, 2026

The machine-readable gate record is
[`financial-readiness-evidence-2026-08-18.json`](./financial-readiness-evidence-2026-08-18.json).
The final checker is:

```sh
deno task financial:gate
```

Each gate declares its accepted evidence classes. Operational gates require `staging-real` or
`production-real` evidence. Repository proof is accepted only for deterministic mechanical
invariants that do not claim deployment behavior: artifact integrity and historical-key
verification. Every gate must still pass before `GO`.

Executed evidence:

- Type checking, formatting, linting, package boundaries, 186 contract tests, and 195 full-suite
  tests passed.
- The API now reaches its listening state after exact import-map aliases were added for all
  transitive dependencies of the pinned Effect beta.103 Deno adapter.
- The worker now passes Effect module loading and reaches PostgreSQL, but the selected local
  database lacks `process.jobs`; process-kill and lease-expiry rehearsal remains blocked until a
  migrated disposable database is used.
- A real TigerBeetle `0.17.9` one-replica development process was formatted, started, terminated
  with `SIGTERM`, restarted from the same replica file, and passed the live adapter integration test
  before and after restart.
- PostgreSQL `19beta3` was dumped with the matching `pg_dump`, restored into an independent local
  database, and reopened successfully. This was not a production cohort and had no corresponding
  TigerBeetle restore.
- Artifact hashing, Ed25519 verification, forgery rejection, PostgreSQL immutability, and
  historical-key verification after signer rotation passed deterministic tests.
- No multi-replica TigerBeetle cluster, quorum-loss rehearsal, production KMS/HSM signer, alert
  pipeline, global transfer scan, or bounded production-equivalent cohort was available.

The mechanically evaluated result is therefore:

```text
NO-GO — PostgreSQL remains the default financial engine.
```
