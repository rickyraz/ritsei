## Readiness Rule

A package is a Process Studio capability provider only when a requested action has a stable public
contract and executable invariant proof. A package directory or table is not evidence of domain
maturity.

Each provider must expose, as applicable:

```text
public command/query contract
Effect Schema input/output
stable tagged failures
capability, tenant, and object scope
relationship/object authorization through the RITSEI AuthZ abstraction
transaction and concurrency semantics
idempotency and retry behavior
compensation or manual recovery
versioned event contract
contract and database tests
```

## Maturity Levels

### Level 0 — Scaffold

A package exists or owns a schema, but it must not be registered as a Process Studio action
provider.

Required next step:

```text
owner -> public contract -> schema/invariants -> tests -> authorization
```

### Level 1 — Domain Contract

The package has:

- public commands and queries through `mod.ts`;
- Effect Schema DTOs;
- tagged business failures;
- tenant-aware ownership;
- authorization tests;
- schema and migration checks;
- package boundary compliance.

### Level 2 — Transactional Capability

The package additionally proves:

- local atomic transaction boundaries;
- database constraints;
- concurrency behavior;
- retry and idempotency behavior;
- rollback after intermediate failure;
- correction/reversal or explicit manual recovery.

### Level 3 — Process Provider

The package additionally publishes:

- versioned Typed Action Catalog entries;
- capability stability and release state;
- versioned Typed Event Catalog entries;
- precondition/effect metadata with a bounded vocabulary;
- process-visible failures;
- correlation and causation behavior;
- compensation metadata;
- catalog compatibility tests against public contracts.

Only Level 3 capabilities may appear as production Process Studio actions/events. A package may
remain `PARTIAL` while one narrow capability satisfies Level 3; maturity is not inherited by sibling
commands.

A plugin follows the same maturity levels, with additional requirements from its trust level: owned
schema and migration isolation for trusted extensions, contributor-contract compatibility for
catalog entries, and no core-invariant access for declarative or sandboxed extensions. Plugin
installation alone never makes a capability Process Studio-ready.

## Delivery Sequence

### D0 — Stabilize Existing Foundations

```text
kernel
identity
auth
authorization
party
```

Goals:

- explicit tenant and organization vocabulary;
- stable human, service, process, and delegated principals;
- provider-neutral authentication and RITSEI account-mapping boundary, with ZITADEL as the recommended adapter;
- permission matrix, scoped capability, relationship, and SoD ownership;
- party roles and external identifiers;
- transaction and error mapping conventions;
- audit/correlation ownership decision.

### D1 — Complete the Economic Core

```text
inventory
accounting
sales
procurement
billing
```

Goals:

- purchase-to-pay path has supplier, purchase, receipt, return, invoice, and settlement ownership;
- order-to-cash path has customer, order, fulfillment, invoice, payment, and credit-policy
  ownership;
- inventory movement and accounting correction semantics are explicit;
- period and close controls exist before workflow actions depend on them.

Do not implement every subfeature in one phase. Each command must pass the primitive readiness test
and have a narrow public contract.

Procurement now owns `SupplierAccount` and the atomic draft, read, idempotent confirmation, and
terminal cancellation lifecycle defined by the canonical
[`../architecture/procurement.md`](../architecture/procurement.md) specification. Confirmed and
cancelled snapshots are immutable and have no supplier-acceptance, stock, invoice, accounting, event,
or Process Studio effect. Receipt ownership and its concurrency with cancellation are the next gates.

### D2 — Publish Catalog Providers

Select a small cross-domain set, for example:

```text
inventory.stock.reserve
inventory.stock.transfer.confirm
inventory.stock.transfer.complete
accounting.journal.post
sales.order.confirm
procurement.purchase_receipt.receive
```

For every selected action:

- register a versioned catalog entry;
- register its output and failure schema;
- declare capability and tenant scope;
- declare idempotency and transaction semantics;
- declare compensation or manual recovery;
- publish a typed event when a committed fact is process-visible;
- prove catalog metadata matches the public contract.

### D3 — Add Missing Operational Domains Only by Evidence

Potential domains:

```text
manufacturing
quality
asset management
maintenance
projects
field service
HR/payroll
```

They remain `OPTIONAL` until a concrete product capability requires them. A package is created only
when it owns an invariant that cannot remain in an existing domain.

## Current Level 3 Evidence

The bounded internal catalog currently has six eligible Level 3 action/event slices:

```text
inventory.stock.adjust v1
  -> PUBLIC action + inventory.stock.corrected v1
  -> owner-controlled atomic publication
  -> idempotent correction and rollback proofs

sales.order.confirm v1
  -> PUBLIC action + sales.order.confirmed v1
  -> Sales-owned line total and atomic publication
  -> authorization, idempotency, invalid-state, and rollback proofs

accounting.revenue.posted v1
  -> PUBLIC event from the owner-controlled revenue transaction
  -> accounting.revenue.post v1 is PUBLIC and uses the confirmed Sales order total as the server-derived amount

procurement.purchase_order.confirm v1
  -> PUBLIC action + procurement.purchase_order.confirmed v1
  -> owner-transactional confirmation and Messaging publication
  -> idempotent replay and catalog compatibility proofs

party.create v1
  -> PUBLIC action + party.created v1
  -> tenant-scoped authorization and owner event publication
  -> catalog compatibility and PostgreSQL persistence proof

identity.user_account.create v1
  -> PUBLIC action + identity.user_account.created v1
  -> global account storage with tenant-context authorization
  -> dependency-safe publisher composition and PostgreSQL persistence proof
```

This satisfies the bounded Level 3 action-provider gate for Sales, Inventory, and Accounting for
bounded catalog work. It does not make all Inventory, Sales, or Accounting commands process-safe,
activate PgQue, implement external connectors, or authorize the broad workflow runtime.

## Domain Gate Before Workflow Runtime

Do not start a broad workflow runtime until:

```text
[x] at least two domains reach Level 3
[x] procurement is no longer an empty provider if purchase workflows are in scope
[x] billing/accounting ownership is clear for financial workflows; Billing remains explicitly out of scope under ADR-0060
[x] all catalog actions have stable failures and authorization
[x] events have typed schemas and correlation fields
[x] compensation/manual recovery is explicit for committed effects
[x] catalog version compatibility is tested
[x] no provider leaks tables, repositories, or infrastructure errors
```

## Deliberate Non-Goals

This roadmap does not promise that every SAP or Odoo functional area becomes a package. It
prioritizes coherent domain ownership and end-to-end ERP correctness over menu completeness.
