## Rule

External integration must be a typed, versioned, observable boundary. It must
not become a shortcut around domain ownership or a reason to expose transport
internals to Process Studio.

```text
external protocol
        ↓
connector adapter
        ↓
ExternalAction / ExternalEvent
        ↓
public domain contract or Process Studio
```

## 0.8 — Contract Profile

Establish the golden profile:

```text
HTTPS + JSON + OpenAPI 3.2.0
CloudEvents 1.0.x over HTTPS/Webhook
AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event catalog
OAuth 2.0 + RFC 9700 security practices
RFC 9457 Problem Details
```

Exit criteria:

- `DomainAction`/`ExternalAction` and `DomainEvent`/`ExternalEvent` are distinct;
- connector IDs, versions, schemas, scopes, and tenant boundaries are typed;
- OpenAPI operations are allowlisted before import;
- CloudEvents envelope and external payload are separately validated;
- provider credentials never enter Process IR or domain contracts.

## 0.85 — Connector Runtime

Implement the minimum headless connector path:

```text
OpenAPI action invocation
HTTPS webhook ingestion
CloudEvents validation
OAuth scope enforcement
idempotency and deduplication
timeout and bounded retry
delivery log
```

Exit criteria:

- duplicate provider requests/events are safe;
- provider timeout and unknown outcome are observable;
- external errors normalize to stable integration failures;
- connector calls do not extend PostgreSQL transactions across the network;
- compensation or manual recovery is explicit for every side-effecting action.

## 0.9 — Reliability and Compatibility

Add operational maturity:

```text
dead-letter handling
replay protection
rate and payload limits
redaction and retention
provider status tracking
contract compatibility checks
connector health and lag metrics
```

Advanced adapters may be added behind the same normalized boundary:

```text
gRPC
Kafka
AMQP
NATS
SQS / Pub/Sub / EventBridge
SOAP
OData
```

Exit criteria:

- advanced protocols are invisible to Process IR;
- each adapter has an owner, version, compatibility range, and test suite;
- provider-specific retries and acknowledgments do not leak into domain code;
- connector plugin trust and secret handling pass review.

The bounded provider-neutral persistence proof now covers tenant-scoped replay protection, normalized
provider status, retry/dead-letter outcomes, redaction, compatibility and payload-limit checks, and
connector health/lag metrics across a PostgreSQL restart. It does not activate a provider adapter or
claim production readiness for the broader 0.9 profile.

## 0.95 — Process Studio Integration

Expose approved connector capabilities to Process Studio:

```text
Integrations
└── Midtrans
    ├── CreatePayment
    └── RefundPayment

External Events
└── Midtrans.PaymentSettled
```

Exit criteria:

- external actions/events are catalog-driven and versioned;
- transport details are absent from the canvas;
- OAuth scopes and domain capabilities remain separate;
- static validation understands schemas, scope, idempotency, timeout, retry, and
  compensation metadata;
- connector operations can be simulated without real provider side effects.

The bounded Process Studio bridge now exposes only PUBLIC, allowlisted catalog references, strips
transport metadata from Process IR, validates typed action mappings, keeps OAuth scope separate from
domain authorization, and supports side-effect-free simulation. It does not execute providers or
own domain mutations.

## 1.0 — Governed Integration Surface

Deliver:

```text
connector registration and review
OpenAPI import governance
webhook registration and verification
external action/event publication
connector versioning and retirement
operator delivery/retry controls
provider-specific runbooks
integration audit and redaction
```

Exit criteria:

- no unreviewed connector operation is executable;
- connector lifecycle is independent from domain lifecycle;
- published process versions remain compatible with connector versions;
- external effects support safe retry, compensation, or manual recovery;
- public documentation can be generated from the approved contracts.

The bounded governance proof now persists reviewed/active/retired connector versions, rejects
unreviewed activation and controls after retirement, records idempotent delivery controls, and
retains append-only audit entries under an explicit retention horizon. Provider-specific runbooks and
production adapter activation remain separate follow-up work.

## Hard Stops

Do not expose an external connector to Process Studio when:

- the provider operation has no idempotency or unknown-outcome strategy;
- OAuth scope is being used as a substitute for domain authorization;
- the operation requires arbitrary script, SQL, or unrestricted HTTP;
- its error/timeout/retry semantics are undocumented;
- credentials or raw provider payloads would enter Process IR;
- no owner exists for the connector adapter;
- compensation/manual recovery is undefined for a committed side effect.
