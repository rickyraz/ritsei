## Rule

An ERP primitive is ready for Process Studio composition only when its semantic meaning is stable
across domain contracts, persistence, authorization, events, and correction behavior.

A primitive does not automatically require its own package. Package boundaries follow invariant
ownership and public capability, not a roadmap checklist. The orthogonal areas are a semantic map;
they do not become packages by enumeration.

## Decision States

```text
KNOWN
  repository already establishes the semantic rule

PARTIAL
  a useful implementation exists but the cross-domain contract is incomplete

UNKNOWN
  a material business decision cannot be recovered from the repository

DECIDED
  an ADR or canonical domain document has selected the rule

READY
  the selected rule has public contracts, executable proof, and operational behavior
```

`UNKNOWN` is not permission to guess. It is a gate that blocks dependent runtime work until
resolved.

## Business Surface and Invariant Layer

Concrete business documents are the developer-facing surface of owner-local capabilities. They do
not replace the semantic primitive map and do not imply a universal document package or table.

```text
business surface -> owner action -> semantic owner fact
SalesOrder       -> confirm      -> Sales-owned order fact
PurchaseOrder    -> confirm      -> Procurement-owned order fact
Delivery         -> receive/move -> Inventory-owned movement fact
Invoice          -> post         -> future Billing/Accounting contract
```

The final row remains gated. A surface name is not evidence that its owner, lifecycle, correction,
authorization, or financial policy has been decided. `Commitment`, `Fulfillment`, `Movement`,
`Posting`, and `Settlement` remain semantic capabilities; they become explicit owner-local entities
when their invariants require it, not because the roadmap lists them.

Developer ergonomics is a separate roadmap concern. Structural schema, DTO, query, form, CRUD, and
test scaffolding may be generated after owner contracts are stable. Business actions, authorization,
transactions, consequences, and fact authority remain explicit and owner-controlled.

## Plugin Boundary

Plugins are an extension mechanism for approved primitive capabilities, not a second ownership
system.

- `CORE` and `TRUSTED_SERVER` extensions may own a new primitive only when they declare an owned
  schema, public contract, capabilities, migrations, tests, and compatibility policy.
- A trusted plugin may register Typed Action and Event Catalog entries through an approved
  contributor contract.
- `DECLARATIVE` extensions may configure existing primitives, policies, forms, reports,
  notifications, and safe automations; they cannot define new core invariants or arbitrary commands.
- `SANDBOXED` extensions cannot receive direct database, native, or core invariant access.
- No plugin may redefine or directly mutate a core domain's invariant.

A plugin primitive is not Process Studio-ready until it satisfies the same Level 3 provider gate in
[`domain-maturity.md`](./domain-maturity.md).

## Primitive Backlog

| Quantity and movement     | Non-negative balances, concurrent reservations/transfers, UOM validation, append-oriented corrections                                             | `READY` (P1 baseline)               | Lot/serial, valuation, and fractional quantity remain out of scope                                          |

| Policy and authorization  | Capability catalog, permission matrix, tenant/scope checks, and deny-by-default cover current actions; relationship evaluation is a target boundary | `READY` for current actions         | Add object authorization, approval, override, and SoD policy only with owner contracts and denial proofs |
| Business surface ergonomics | Owner-local documents and explicit actions are established; generated structural tooling is not activated | `PLANNED` | Prove Product and SalesOrder slices without a universal ORM or document kernel |

| Typed actions and events  | Inventory, Sales, and Accounting publish bounded PUBLIC v1 action/event contracts; Accounting derives revenue from the confirmed Sales order fact | `READY` for selected Level 3 slices | Future Process Studio owns aggregation/release; broader domain actions remain gated by their own invariants |
| Compensation and recovery | Order cancellation releases reservations and reverses revenue; fulfillment and manual recovery are explicit                                       | `READY` (bounded lifecycle)         | Returns, credits, and external compensation require later owner decisions                                   |

## Decision Order

### P0 — Scope and User Accounts

**P0 baseline status: `READY`.** All P0-01 through P0-10 tasks have public contracts and executable
proof. Deployment of historical databases remains conditional on the explicit operator-supplied
identifier and Legal Entity mappings described below; readiness does not authorize inferred
backfills.

The initial scope and user-account decisions are recorded in
[`../decisions/0021-define-p0-scope-and-identity-model.md`](../decisions/0021-define-p0-scope-and-identity-model.md).
Public user-account and Party vocabulary follows
[`../decisions/0029-rename-user-and-party-public-vocabulary.md`](../decisions/0029-rename-user-and-party-public-vocabulary.md).
The first implementation slice covers tenant timezone, Organization, Legal Entity, optional Branch,
Warehouse and accounting Legal Entity scope, PartyRepresentation, scoped external identifiers, and
the bootstrap vertical slice. Advanced localization, journal policy, and legacy deployment upgrades
remain bounded follow-up work.

Resolve before adding cross-domain business flows:

```text
tenant
legal entity/company
branch
warehouse/location
party/customer/supplier
internal vs external identifiers
currency and timezone scope
```

Exit criteria:

- ownership is assigned for each scope fact;
- composite references cannot cross tenant or organization boundaries;
- public contracts use stable internal identifiers;
- external identifiers are attached through the owning domain;
- an ADR exists for any difficult-to-reverse identity or organization choice.

### P0 Implementation Task Board

Complete these tasks in order. Each task requires implementation evidence and focused contract,
database, authorization, or integration tests; a completed schema or migration alone is not
sufficient.

| ID      | Task                                                                                                                                   | Required proof                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `P0-01` | Freeze vocabulary and ownership for Tenant, UserAccount, Party, Organization, Legal Entity, Branch, Warehouse, currency, and timezone. | Ownership matrix, public terminology, and no unresolved P0 naming collision.                                                                                                                                  |
| `P0-02` | Harden tenant and legal-entity isolation.                                                                                              | Composite foreign keys, unique constraints, and negative tests reject cross-tenant and cross-legal-entity references.                                                                                         |
| `P0-03` | Complete UserAccount membership and capability context.                                                                                | One UserAccount can access multiple Tenants through separate memberships; PartyRepresentation never grants authorization by itself.                                                                           |
| `P0-04` | Implement Organization and Legal Entity lifecycle.                                                                                     | Owner-local commands, one-to-one Organization/Legal Entity constraint, tenant-scoped administration, and tagged failure tests.                                                                                |
| `P0-05` | Implement Branch scope and local metadata.                                                                                             | Branch is optional and operational/reporting scoped; timezone overrides, local tax registration, and dedicated journals are possible without creating an independent ledger, fiscal period, or base currency. |
| `P0-06` | Bind Warehouse and stock ownership to Legal Entity.                                                                                    | A Warehouse has one authoritative Legal Entity owner, an optional primary Branch association, and stock cannot cross Legal Entity scope without an explicit transfer.                                         |
| `P0-07` | Complete Legal Entity accounting configuration.                                                                                        | Accounting owns base currency, precision, fiscal period, and posting configuration; Branch cannot override those authorities.                                                                                 |
| `P0-08` | Complete PartyRole and PartyRelationship contracts.                                                                                    | One tenant-scoped Party may be customer and supplier; Legal Entity relationships carry eligibility and terms without becoming authorization grants.                                                           |
| `P0-09` | Stabilize identifiers and public contracts.                                                                                            | Internal IDs remain stable and opaque; external IDs are scoped to provider/tenant/Legal Entity; Effect Schema commands, outputs, and failures have contract tests.                                            |
| `P0-10` | Prove the bootstrap vertical slice and failure boundaries.                                                                             | Tenant → Party → Legal Entity → Branch → accounting configuration → Warehouse succeeds; duplicate, unauthorized, cross-tenant, cross-entity, and conflicting external-ID cases fail with typed errors.        |

P0 is `READY` only when all ten tasks have executable proof. The bootstrap coordinator may compose
owner-local commands but must not become a new domain owner or universal persistence model.

Current implementation evidence: P0-01, P0-02, P0-03, P0-04, P0-06, P0-07, P0-08, and P0-10 have
owner-local contracts, constraints, and tests. P0-03 now has explicit UserAccount lifecycle, tenant
membership persistence, membership-aware capability checks, PartyRepresentation persistence, and
capability checks. ADR-0031 is implemented for the current modules with a canonical catalog, owner
declarations, validator, capability grant migration, and compatibility tests. P0-05 stores
branch-local tax-registration and dedicated-journal metadata without moving tax or journal ownership
into `party`. P0-09 has an explicit mapping backfill command. Legacy databases still require an
operator-supplied mapping before the historical non-null scope migrations can be replayed; the
command fails closed rather than inferring ownership.

The `P0-06` migration does not infer Legal Entity ownership for existing warehouse or transfer rows.
Deployments with existing inventory data need an explicit, reviewed backfill in the deployment
migration; this migration fails closed rather than inventing ownership.

The initial `P0-07` configuration is one accounting-owned row per tenant and Legal Entity with a
three-letter base-currency code, decimal precision, fiscal-year start month, and posting-enabled
flag. Fiscal close/reopen and jurisdiction-specific currency rules remain out of scope.

The initial `P0-08` relationship is tenant-scoped to one Party and one Legal Entity, reuses a
PartyRole kind, requires that role to be assigned first, and starts active. It is a business
eligibility relationship, not an authorization grant.

The `P0-09` identifier migration requires an explicit provider backfill for existing identifier
rows; it does not invent a provider or Legal Entity scope. Tenant-wide identifiers use a separate
uniqueness path from Legal Entity-scoped identifiers.

The `P0-10` bootstrap proof lives in the application composition layer. It is a trusted,
non-self-service sequence that grants the bootstrap principal the minimum tenant capabilities and
then invokes owner-local Party, Accounting, and Inventory commands. It does not write domain tables
directly or expose a bootstrap HTTP endpoint. The current public services do not carry a reusable
cross-domain transaction context, so this proof covers sequencing and typed failure boundaries;
atomic rollback across domains remains a separate transaction-contract requirement.

### P1 — Product, Quantity, and Location

The baseline is decided by
[`../decisions/0035-define-p1-inventory-primitives.md`](../decisions/0035-define-p1-inventory-primitives.md):
Inventory owns discrete stock Items with one immutable stock UOM, whole-number quantities,
Warehouse-level location, no negative stock, and append-oriented corrections. Unit conversion,
fractional stock, bins, lot/serial traceability, and valuation remain explicitly out of scope until
required.

Resolve before adding procurement, manufacturing, or advanced inventory actions:

```text
product vs service
SKU and classification
unit of measure and conversion
warehouse and location hierarchy
reservation and availability
lot/serial traceability
negative stock and correction policy
```

Exit criteria:

- quantity inputs and outputs have typed units;
- inventory movement facts are append-oriented or compensated;
- reservation and availability are concurrency-safe;
- location and ownership constraints are database-enforced where applicable.

### P2 — Documents and Financial Semantics

The baseline is decided by
[`../decisions/0036-define-p2-document-and-financial-baseline.md`](../decisions/0036-define-p2-document-and-financial-baseline.md):
documents remain owner-local; committed economic facts are corrected by new commands and reversals;
the current executable posting flow is single-Legal-Entity, base-currency, fixed two-decimal money;
and tax, invoices, AP/AR, payments, settlement, reopen, and adjusting periods remain explicitly out
of scope until their owners and lifecycles are decided. Financial execution migration is sequenced
separately by [`financial-ledger-execution.md`](./financial-ledger-execution.md); it does not expand
this business scope.

The bounded Procurement document is defined by the canonical
[`../architecture/procurement.md`](../architecture/procurement.md) specification, with historical
baseline rationale in ADR-0044 and ADR-0045. The current Level 2 lifecycle creates a private draft,
freezes it through idempotent internal confirmation, and preserves the committed snapshot through
terminal cancellation. Receipt ownership and its concurrency with cancellation remain gated.

Resolve before cataloging purchase, sales, billing, payment, or close actions:

```text
document identity and references
header/line semantics
currency and monetary precision
tax ownership
payable and receivable ownership
invoice/payment/settlement lifecycle
fiscal period and close
```

Exit criteria:

- document transitions have preconditions, effects, authorization, and retry behavior;
- accounting facts cannot be rewritten to hide correction;
- financial actions declare reversal or manual recovery;
- period rules are enforced transactionally.

### P3 — Audit, Events, and Integration

**P3 baseline status: `READY` for the bounded PostgreSQL-internal baseline.** Inventory stock
correction and Accounting revenue posting publish owner-controlled PUBLIC v1 events atomically;
Process publishes only its own confirmation, cancellation, and fulfillment lifecycle facts;
completed consumer receipts make PostgreSQL-local delivery duplicate-safe. PgQue activation,
external connectors, Process event waits, and deployment-specific retention remain gated and are not
implied by this status.

The baseline is decided by
[`../decisions/0037-define-p3-audit-event-and-delivery-boundary.md`](../decisions/0037-define-p3-audit-event-and-delivery-boundary.md)
and
[`../decisions/0038-move-internal-event-delivery-to-messaging.md`](../decisions/0038-move-internal-event-delivery-to-messaging.md):
owner-domain facts remain business audit authority; Messaging owns shared envelope/outbox/receipt
infrastructure; catalog declarations remain domain-owned through a neutral typed contributor
contract; delivery is at-least-once with durable consumer receipts; payloads are minimized and
redacted; and PgQue plus external connectors remain behind their existing activation gates.

Resolve before durable process execution:

```text
audit event ownership
correlation and causation
Typed Event Catalog
external adapter identity and version
outbox and delivery semantics
redaction and retention
```

Exit criteria:

- committed facts publish typed versioned events atomically where required;
- consumers and process waits are idempotent;
- audit records preserve actor, tenant, command, state, and correlation;
- external standards remain behind versioned integration adapters.

## What Must Not Be Added Yet

Do not add these merely because they are common in other ERP products:

```text
lot/serial tracking
multiple currencies
tax localization
valuation layers
manufacturing
HR/payroll
asset management
advanced approvals
AI/RPA
full BPMN/DMN semantics
```

They become roadmap work only when the primitive decision is relevant to a requested capability and
its evidence, ownership, contract, and proof strategy are defined.

## Primitive Readiness Test

A primitive is `READY` only if all answers are explicit:

```text
Who owns the invariant?
What are the public inputs and outputs?
What tenant/organization scope applies?
What constraints protect the final state?
What commands change it?
What events expose committed facts?
What authorization is required?
What happens under retry and concurrency?
How is a committed effect corrected?
What is the smallest executable proof?
```
