## Decision

RITSEI uses different primitives for different semantics:

```text
Direct PostgreSQL transaction
-> synchronous business invariants

PgQue
-> durable event stream and fan-out

Job table
-> leased, scheduled, prioritized work

Lease semantics
-> random capability token for possession checks; monotonic generation for stale-writer fencing

pg_durable
-> checkpointed multi-step workflow
```

Effect fibers are not durable. A Stateful Entity Runtime owns selected active entity state and
serialization; it does not replace checkpointed multi-step workflow execution or durable
accepted-work semantics. TigerBeetle-backed financial operations use the financial-ledger protocol:
PostgreSQL intent, deterministic submission, engine outcome, projection, and reconciliation. They
must not be disguised as one direct PostgreSQL transaction.

## Compatibility Gate

`pg_durable` may become the workflow engine only after it:

- supports PostgreSQL 19;
- passes load and crash-recovery tests;
- provides observable workflow state;
- demonstrates safe migration and upgrade behavior.

Until then, a compatibility job layer remains available. The first bounded implementation uses the
`packages/process` coordination owner and its PostgreSQL workflow-run and job tables, plus the
Messaging-owned transactional event outbox and consumer receipts. It does not claim that a worker or
`pg_durable` is authoritative. PgQue activation additionally requires the installer, ticker, grants,
upgrade, and adapter gate defined by
[ADR-0033](../decisions/0033-extend-order-lifecycle-and-gate-pgque.md).

A job's random lease token is an opaque capability checked by equality. It is not a formal fencing
proof. A side effect that can outlive a lease must use a monotonic lease generation at the actual
mutation boundary; the fenced resource stores its own highest accepted generation and rejects lower
values. The generation is monotonic for one durable job row, never resets while that identity exists,
and is not globally ordered across different jobs. Checking the token only when completing the job
is insufficient. The capability-versus-fencing decision is owned by
[ADR-0052](../decisions/0052-separate-lease-capability-and-fencing-generation.md) and its invariants
by [ADR-0053](../decisions/0053-clarify-per-job-lease-generation-invariants.md).

## Direct Transaction Examples

- post an invoice on the PostgreSQL profile;
- reserve stock;
- allocate a payment on its decided owner/profile;
- close a fiscal period;
- assign a critical role.

TigerBeetle-backed financial posting is a durable accepted-work protocol rather than a direct
PostgreSQL transaction; its exact scope is owned by [`financial-ledger.md`](./financial-ledger.md).

These operations must complete atomically before success is returned.

## Durable Workflow Examples

- tenant provisioning;
- month-end closing;
- bulk import;
- payment settlement;
- approval with timers;
- multi-step external integration.

## Workflow Requirements

Each workflow must define:

- idempotency key;
- step boundaries;
- retry policy;
- timeout policy;
- compensating action when applicable;
- observable progress;
- cancellation semantics;
- audit correlation.

A workflow must not replace a local transaction invariant.

The runtime must persist step state, execution context, idempotency keys, retry state, unknown
external outcomes, compensation progress, and manual-recovery state. Detailed Process Studio
release, promotion, authority, and observability semantics are governed by
[`../decisions/0020-adopt-capability-release-and-runtime-governance.md`](../decisions/0020-adopt-capability-release-and-runtime-governance.md).

Typed action/event catalogs, Process IR, definition versioning, static validation, and compensation
semantics are owned by [`process-studio.md`](./process-studio.md). The durable engine must preserve
those semantics without becoming their source of truth.
