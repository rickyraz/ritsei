## Position

PostgreSQL 19 is the development floor and the transactional core for the control plane and
non-ledger domain state. The project may track beta and release-candidate builds during development
but must move to PostgreSQL 19 GA before production deployment. The `platform/postgres` adapter
rejects connections whose `server_version_num` is below `190000` before running application work. The financial ledger profile
uses TigerBeetle for accepted transfers and balances through the boundary in
[`financial-ledger.md`](./financial-ledger.md).

## Application Shape

RITSEI is a modular monolith with multiple executables:

```text
ritsei-api
ritsei-worker
ritsei-migrate
ritsei-event-relay
```

They share business modules and one logical PostgreSQL ownership model. This does not promise one
physical server, process, or database placement.

Workload-isolated deployments may run separate command, query, and async composition roots with
distinct credentials, pools, and hard resource budgets. This is resource topology inside one
application family, not domain microservices. Query workers that claim hard projection isolation do
not possess a PostgreSQL-primary credential. A separate bounded read-only authorization path may
serve sensitive projection queries. Async lifecycle roles remain narrow; async-triggered business
commands re-enter the command role and transaction path.

## Logical Database and Physical Placement

RITSEI's PostgreSQL contract is logical. It describes the authoritative namespace and transaction
semantics exposed to the application, not a permanent one-server topology.

```text
domain contract
    ↓
foundation database and platform placement boundary
    ↓
approved PostgreSQL 19+ placement(s)
```

The current baseline is one PostgreSQL placement. Primary/replica routing remains route-scoped and
opt-in. Future placements may be tenant-, legal-entity-, warehouse-, or region-oriented, but
placement keys and routing metadata stay in foundation, runtime, and platform layers. Business
modules, public DTOs, capabilities, events, Process IR, URLs, and client configuration must
not name physical servers, shards, regions, replicas, pools, or routers.

A logical endpoint is not a guarantee of one physical connection or portable session state.
Transactions, RLS context, locks, sequences, idempotency, and uniqueness are placement-scoped unless
an explicit architecture decision defines a broader protocol. Existing invariant-sensitive
cross-domain transactions remain on one transactionally compatible placement. Splitting one requires
a new consistency, migration, recovery, and reconciliation decision.

Cross-placement reads may serve explicitly bounded projections, reports, search, graph, or
reconciliation queries. They are not a second authority, must preserve tenant and authorization
boundaries, and must not fall back silently to command or primary resources. Data placement and
WorkloadCell placement are orthogonal; neither changes semantic ownership.

Sharding and distributed routing are not activated by this rule. They require measured need and the
evidence defined by
[ADR-0067](../decisions/0067-separate-logical-database-and-physical-data-placement.md).

## Domain Ownership

The implemented schema registry is:

```text
system.*         -> foundation/platform
identity.*       -> identity
party.*          -> party
auth.*           -> auth
authorization.*  -> authorization
sales.*          -> sales
procurement.*    -> procurement
inventory.*      -> inventory
accounting.*     -> accounting
process.*        -> process
billing.*        -> billing
integration.*    -> integrations
messaging.*      -> messaging
```

`modules/catalog` is contract-only and owns no PostgreSQL schema. Planned domains do not receive a
schema until a concrete invariant requires one and the ownership registry is updated. A module must
not perform arbitrary mutations against another module's schema; it must call the owner through a
typed public contract.

## Transactional Truth

PostgreSQL stores the ERP control-plane and non-ledger state that determines business truth,
including:

- parties and legal entities;
- orders and commitments;
- reservations and stock movements;
- invoices and payments;
- account meaning, fiscal periods, and posting policy;
- permissions and workflow state;
- audit events;
- integration outbox entries;
- durable jobs;
- journal/document metadata and rebuildable financial projections.

For an activated financial ledger profile, TigerBeetle is authoritative for accepted financial
transfers, balances, balance constraints, and immutable transfer history. PostgreSQL stores the
operation intent, deterministic identity mapping, audit references, and projection state; those
records do not become a competing financial authority.

RITSEI authorization authority follows the same rule: PostgreSQL stores canonical membership,
roles, capabilities, grants, scopes, SoD policy, and authorization versions. Native PostgreSQL is the
default RelationshipEngine implementation. SpiceDB, when selected, is an optional replaceable
relationship/object evaluator or projection; its tuples, revisions, and caches are not a second RITSEI
authority. Tenant isolation remains enforced independently through tenant-aware keys, validated
application context, and PostgreSQL RLS.

Redis, ClickHouse, search indexes, external authorization evaluators, and caches are not authoritative.

## Integrity Rules

- Prefer composite tenant-aware keys where appropriate.
- Use foreign keys and checks for structural invariants.
- Use unique constraints for identity rules.
- Use explicit transaction isolation for concurrency-sensitive operations.
- Use row or advisory locks only with documented lock ordering.
- Keep PostgreSQL-owned financial metadata and projections append-oriented.
- Record corrections through reversal or compensating entries; accepted TigerBeetle transfers are
  never edited or deleted.
- Warehouse transfers are transactional inventory operations: confirmation
  deducts source availability, while completion credits the destination.
- Do not treat a TigerBeetle call as part of a PostgreSQL transaction; use the durable financial-ledger
  protocol and reconcile cross-store outcomes.

## Migration Integrity

Migration discovery is deterministic by timestamped directory name. Names, versions, checksums, and
snapshot ancestry must form one valid ordered catalog.

Applied named migrations are immutable. Before applying pending migrations, the runtime migration
adapter compares the
local catalog with `system.schema_migrations` and rejects missing, modified, duplicated, reordered,
or retroactively inserted migration identities. A semantic change to an applied migration requires a
new migration rather than rewriting history.

Clean-database migration tests apply the complete discovered catalog and verify idempotent re-entry.
Domain-specific database tests verify observable constraints and trigger behavior instead of
matching historical SQL text.

## Projections

Create projections only when measured read requirements justify them. Projections must be
rebuildable from authoritative facts or have an explicit reconciliation process.

Dashboard, search, reporting, and relationship-evaluation routes may use separate projection
stores to prevent degradable reads from consuming command resources. A relationship projection must
be rebuildable from canonical RITSEI facts and must carry an explicit freshness and revocation
contract; stale or unknown relationship state fails closed for sensitive work. Analytical projections
follow the domain-owned fact,
versioned metric, freshness, correction, and provider gates in
[`analytics-architecture.md`](./analytics-architecture.md). A hard-isolated projection route must not
silently fall back to the primary when its projection path is stale, unavailable, or saturated.

PostgreSQL 19 `WAIT FOR` is selected by ADR-0039 for route-scoped replica-backed read-your-writes.
A procurement pilot is implemented behind opt-in configuration; it is not active merely because a
replica exists, nor does it mean the replica equals the primary's latest state. Raw WAL and LSN
details remain inside PostgreSQL
infrastructure behind an opaque consistency context. Production activation requires PostgreSQL 19
GA and the route, timeout, timeline, authorization, no-fallback, load, and failover gates owned by
[`state-and-consistency.md`](./state-and-consistency.md).

Search indexes over canonical tables are physical access paths, not new business facts. Cross-domain
search documents and embeddings are rebuildable projections governed by
[`search-architecture.md`](./search-architecture.md). A PostgreSQL search extension must support the
project's PostgreSQL 19 floor and pass installation, migration, recovery, replication, workload, and
exit gates before production use.

## Guarantee Boundary

PostgreSQL participates in three distinct guarantee levels:

```text
transaction integrity
-> transactions, constraints, isolation, and locks

connection and privilege containment
-> roles, credentials, connection-admission reserve, pools, and timeouts

physical workload non-interference
-> runtime admission plus compute, memory, storage, and network isolation
```

The first two levels can be enforced partly by PostgreSQL. The third requires the workload-isolation
fabric and deployment proof defined by [`workload-isolation.md`](./workload-isolation.md). A shared
primary with separate roles and pools must not be described as physical CPU, memory, I/O, WAL,
storage, or failover isolation. Detailed role grants and the PostgreSQL server reserve are owned by
[`../operations/database-roles.md`](../operations/database-roles.md).

## Operational Requirements

Production readiness requires:

- backup and point-in-time recovery;
- migration rehearsal;
- connection-pool limits and a reviewed total connection budget;
- a non-zero command connection reserve where overload isolation is claimed;
- distinct roles, credentials, and network paths for isolated command, query, and async planes;
- proof that adaptive admission cannot exceed physical pool and executor ceilings;
- observability for lock waits and slow queries;
- invariant checks;
- workload replay and adversarial overload tests for risky changes;
- when the financial ledger profile is enabled, corresponding TigerBeetle backup, restore, upgrade,
  outage, reconciliation, and adapter-exit rehearsals.
