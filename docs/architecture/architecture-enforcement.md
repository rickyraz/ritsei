## Purpose

Architectural boundaries are not considered effective merely because they are
documented. The repository must enforce them through static checks, tests,
database privileges, deployment validation, and CI.

## Package Boundary Model

A domain package may import:

- its own internal modules;
- public contracts exported by another domain;
- approved kernel abstractions;
- shared contract and utility packages that have no domain ownership.

A domain package must not import:

- another domain's table definitions;
- another domain's repository implementations;
- another domain's internal services;
- another domain's migration files;
- application entry points;
- server-only code from frontend packages.

## Business Surface and Generated Ergonomics

Concrete business objects do not create a second authority model. Enforcement must preserve the
following distinction:

- owner-local documents expose public commands, queries, schemas, errors, and layers;
- ordinary structural helpers may update only owner-approved ordinary fields;
- lifecycle and posting fields change only through the owning public action path;
- generated artifacts must not import private tables, repositories, or infrastructure types;
- cross-domain consequences use public contracts and typed transaction or financial-ledger ports;
- ORM hooks, subscribers, and generated callbacks must not become hidden cross-domain authority;
- generated API, form, audit, or event metadata must preserve the owning capability and scope.

Static rules can reject private imports, persistence re-exports, and forbidden package edges. The
transitional Accounting PostgreSQL ledger factory is the only current adapter-export exception; its
scope and removal path are documented in [`financial-ledger.md`](./financial-ledger.md). No other
provider, store, table, or repository implementation may be re-exported. Owner contract tests must
prove protected transitions, authorization, idempotency, correction, and consequence ownership. A
future generator must add its own rule tests before generated artifacts are accepted as a supported
public path.

## Allowed Dependency Direction

```text
apps
  -> domain public contracts
  -> approved kernel abstractions

domain A
  -> domain B public contract

domain A
  -X-> domain B internal implementation

frontend
  -> shared public contracts
  -X-> backend repositories or database schema
```

## Package Boundary Manifest

Each domain package should expose an explicit public entry point.

Example:

```text
packages/inventory/
├── mod.ts
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── queries/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── errors/
│   ├── schema/
│   └── internal/
└── tests/
```

Only exports reachable from `mod.ts` form the public contract.

The boundary checker must reject imports such as:

```ts
import { stockPosition } from "../inventory/src/internal/tables.ts"
```

and allow imports such as:

```ts
import { InventoryService } from "@ritsei/inventory"
```

The current scaffold enforces these checks with:

- `ast-grep` project config: [`../../sgconfig.yml`](../../sgconfig.yml);
- structural rules: [`../../tooling/boundary-linter/rules/`](../../tooling/boundary-linter/rules/);
- rule tests: [`../../tooling/boundary-linter/rule-tests/`](../../tooling/boundary-linter/rule-tests/);
- package-entrypoint and cycle validation:
  [`../../tooling/dependency-graph/check.ts`](../../tooling/dependency-graph/check.ts);
- conservative public call-graph validation:
  [`../../tooling/call-graph/check.ts`](../../tooling/call-graph/check.ts).

## Schema Ownership

Each PostgreSQL schema has exactly one owning module.

The owner may:

- define tables and constraints;
- write to its tables;
- expose transaction-aware services;
- publish facts derived from committed changes.

A non-owner must not issue direct writes against the schema.

Cross-domain consistency must use a public service contract inside the same transaction when
atomicity is required for a PostgreSQL-owned invariant. For a TigerBeetle-backed financial
invariant, use `FinancialLedgerPort` plus the durable intent/outcome/reconciliation protocol; do
not claim cross-store ACID or call the external engine while holding a PostgreSQL transaction open.

## Schema Ownership Registry

Maintain one machine-readable registry, for example:

```toml
[schemas]
identity = "packages/identity"
auth = "packages/authorization"
sales = "packages/sales"
inventory = "packages/inventory"
accounting = "packages/accounting"
process = "packages/process"
billing = "packages/billing"
integration = "packages/integrations"
audit = "packages/audit"
```

The active registry is [`../../db/ownership.toml`](../../db/ownership.toml). It is
validated by [`../../tooling/boundary-linter/check-ownership.ts`](../../tooling/boundary-linter/check-ownership.ts)
and consumed by architecture tests. Future migration and privilege tooling must
use the same registry instead of defining a second ownership map.

## SQL Ownership Checks

Static SQL checks should reject:

- writes to a schema not owned by the current package;
- migrations placed outside the owning module or central reviewed migration tree;
- unqualified table references where schema qualification is required;
- raw SQL that bypasses an approved domain service without an explicit exception.

Approved exceptions must be narrow, documented, and reviewed.

## No Cross-Domain Table Imports

Drizzle table definitions live under `db/schema/` for Drizzle Kit discovery but
remain private persistence infrastructure. A domain implementation may import
only tables owned by that domain according to `db/ownership.toml`.

The linter must detect:

- direct imports of another module's table definitions;
- re-exporting persistence tables through a public contract;
- shared generic repository abstractions that expose arbitrary table access;
- frontend imports of database types or table definitions.

Public DTOs must be separate from persistence models.

## Dependency-Cycle Detection

The package dependency graph must remain acyclic unless a documented framework
edge is explicitly exempted.

The checker must report:

- the full cycle;
- the import path creating each edge;
- the public contract that should replace the internal dependency.

Example invalid cycle:

```text
sales
  -> inventory
  -> accounting
  -> sales
```

A typical correction is to extract a stable contract or invert one dependency
through an Effect service interface. The active checker is
[`../../tooling/dependency-graph/check.ts`](../../tooling/dependency-graph/check.ts)
and runs through `deno task boundary:lint` locally and in CI.

## Public Call Graph

The repository records a conservative static call graph for `apps/`,
`packages/`, `tests/`, and `tooling/`. It tracks:

- direct calls between locally defined functions;
- calls to callable names imported through another package's public `mod.ts`;
- the public package symbol used by each cross-package edge.

The checker rejects a tracked cross-package call when the imported symbol is not
exported by the target package. It is a boundary aid, not proof of every runtime
call: Effect dependency injection, callbacks, reflection, dynamic property
access, and generated code remain outside its static resolution model.

Run it directly with `deno task callgraph:check`; it also runs as part of
`deno task boundary:lint`.

## Workload-Isolation Enforcement

When the workload-isolation fabric is implemented, repository and deployment checks must distinguish
what can be proved statically from what requires runtime evidence.

Static and contract checks should reject:

- capability IDs containing cell, shard, priority, pool, region, or executor topology;
- public routes without owner-reviewed workload metadata;
- query composition roots resolving command database services;
- async lifecycle composition roots mutating core domain facts outside command admission;
- projection routes configured with a primary fallback;
- adaptive limiters without a physical hard ceiling;
- unbounded interactive queue or wait configuration;
- public DTOs, events, entity addresses, or Process IR exposing WorkloadCell or shuffle-shard
  placement.

Secret and deployment checks should reject:

- command credentials mounted into query processes;
- query network access to the primary where hard isolation is claimed;
- async lifecycle roles with broad domain mutation privileges;
- pool maxima whose sum consumes the reviewed command reserve;
- missing CPU, memory, in-flight, or connection hard limits named by the claim;
- simultaneous all-cell deployment where staggered cell isolation is required.

Load and fault-injection tests must prove the remaining behavioral claim. Static boundaries alone do
not prove CPU, memory, I/O, network, storage, or shared-control-plane isolation.

## Architecture Exceptions

An exception must include:

- affected packages;
- reason;
- risk;
- owner;
- expiration or removal condition;
- linked ADR when the exception changes architecture.

Permanent undocumented allowlists are forbidden.

## Required CI Checks

The default branch must reject changes when any of these fail:

```text
package-boundary validation
forbidden-import detection
public call-graph validation
dependency-cycle detection
schema-ownership validation
Drizzle migration-graph validation
Effect-native HTTP validation
architecture tests
relative-link validation for documentation
workload-metadata and topology-leak validation when implemented
```

## Suggested Repository Layout

```text
tooling/
├── boundary-linter/
├── call-graph/
├── dependency-graph/
└── schema-ownership-check/

tests/
└── architecture/

db/
└── ownership.toml
```

## Completion Criteria

Architecture enforcement is complete only when:

- every domain has a declared owner and public entry point;
- every PostgreSQL schema has one registered owner;
- forbidden imports fail locally and in CI;
- dependency cycles fail CI;
- tracked public call edges resolve through public package contracts;
- architecture exceptions are explicit and reviewable;
- database privileges reinforce the same ownership model;
- query, async, and command composition roots cannot acquire one another's protected credentials;
- every published hard-isolation claim has executable overload evidence and explicit exclusions.
