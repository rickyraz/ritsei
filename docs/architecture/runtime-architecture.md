## Position

RITSEI separates durable business truth from active business-state ownership.

```text
PostgreSQL
-> what control-plane and non-ledger business state is durably true

TigerBeetle through FinancialLedgerPort
-> what financial transfers, balances, and transfer history are accepted

Stateful Entity Runtime
-> who owns selected active state and evaluates its next transition

Durable Queue / Workflow Engine
-> what accepted asynchronous work must eventually execute
```

The Stateful Entity Runtime is optional. Stateless Effect services and direct PostgreSQL
transactions remain the default. A domain adopts runtime ownership only for an approved aggregate
category with evidence that identity-local serialization, hot state, or object-local coordination is
required.

Three independent boundaries use similar language and must not be conflated:

```text
StatefulEntity
-> RITSEI aggregate-level serialization and active-state boundary

celld cell
-> one adapter-owned named Durable Object with one active owner and private SQLite state

WorkloadCell
-> deployment resource and fault-containment boundary for a tenant group and workload planes
```

A `WorkloadCell` is governed by [`workload-isolation.md`](./workload-isolation.md). It is not a
stateful entity, aggregate boundary, or authorization grant. A `celld` cell is an adapter
implementation term, not an AWS-style workload cell. `celld` bucket durability does not make its
SQLite state canonical for RITSEI; runtime fields still follow the state classification and the
canonical anchor required by [`state-and-consistency.md`](./state-and-consistency.md) and
[`financial-ledger.md`](./financial-ledger.md) for financial operations. Runtime entity addressing,
WorkloadCell placement, and database placement remain separate concerns.

```

The domain contract owns business behavior. The runtime owns execution routing and entity lifecycle.
PostgreSQL owns committed control-plane and non-ledger facts; TigerBeetle owns accepted financial
movements for the activated profile. Async primitives own delivery and durable progress according to
their existing semantics.

## Runtime Contract

The eventual RITSEI-owned contract should remain minimal. Required concepts are:

```text
EntityType
EntityAddress
EntityCommandId
EntityVersion
EntityRef
EntityRuntime
EntityContext
```

These names describe architectural roles, not a commitment to exact TypeScript APIs. Do not add a
package or abstraction until an experimental workload needs it.

A runtime implementation must support:

- deterministic lookup by entity address;
- one logical active owner at a time;
- stale-owner fencing;
- serialized command admission for one entity;
- bounded activation and recovery;
- runtime-state version inspection;
- adapter-independent errors;
- tracing and metrics;
- a local test implementation;
- category-level disablement or fallback.

The runtime does not grant business permission. Domain authorization still runs for every command,
including commands initiated by Process Studio or plugins.

## Entity Selection

A stateful entity represents a meaningful consistency or activity boundary, not one normalized
database row.

A candidate must have:

1. a stable domain identity;
2. one owning domain capability;
3. a command surface through the owner's public contract;
4. a meaningful serialization boundary;
5. a documented canonical representation and, for financial entities, the TigerBeetle authority
   and PostgreSQL projection;
6. a recovery and reconciliation strategy;
7. measurable or necessary runtime benefit.

Good candidates may include:

```text
InventoryPosition(tenantId, warehouseId, itemId)
WorkflowInstance(tenantId, instanceId)
ReservationBucket(tenantId, resourceType, resourceId)
ReconciliationSession(tenantId, sessionId)
FiscalCloseProcess(tenantId, legalEntityId, fiscalPeriodId)
```

These are examples, not approved implementations.

Poor candidates include static reference rows, arbitrary join-table records, general reporting
queries, full-text search documents, and values that only need a short-lived cache.

## Addressing

Entity addresses are deterministic, tenant-aware, version-stable, and defined by the owning domain.

Conceptual form:

```text
{entityType}/{tenantId}/{domainIdentity...}
```

Example:

```text
inventory-position/{tenantId}/{warehouseId}/{itemId}
```

Rules:

- use opaque internal identifiers, not mutable names or external identifiers;
- include every scope component required to prevent accidental collisions;
- encode and validate components canonically;
- never include node, region, bucket, PostgreSQL shard, or adapter topology;
- do not treat the address as authorization evidence;
- preserve the logical address across adapter replacement.

## Command Routing

```text
request
  |
  v
provider-neutral authenticated principal
  |
  v
decode public command
  |
  v
RITSEI AuthZ: tenant, capability, scope, relationship, domain policy, and SoD
  |
  v
derive entity address in owning domain
  |
  v
resolve EntityRef
  |
  v
route to current owner
  |
  v
serialize and evaluate command
  |
  v
commit the owning canonical protocol
  |
  +--> PostgreSQL transaction for PostgreSQL-owned facts
  +--> FinancialLedgerPort protocol for TigerBeetle-backed financial facts
  |
  v
advance or invalidate runtime projection
  |
  v
return typed result
```

The application must not expose adapter stubs as public domain contracts. Internal calls remain
typed service calls; they do not use loopback HTTP merely because a distributed adapter exists.

## Category Execution Contract

Runtime adoption is optional for RITSEI as a whole. An approved entity category may nevertheless
declare entity-serialized execution as required for its consistency boundary. Once it does, runtime
semantics are mandatory for that category even though the adapter remains replaceable:

- every command that can mutate the same serialized invariant must enter the `StatefulEntityRuntime`
  contract;
- a local or direct-PostgreSQL adapter is a valid fallback only if it preserves the category's
  address, active-owner, fencing, serialization, recovery, and observability semantics;
- a command must not use the runtime for one transition and silently bypass it with a direct domain
  write for another transition on the same invariant;
- the public domain contract, authorization, idempotency, owning financial/PostgreSQL protocol, and
  constraints remain in force on every adapter path;
- the runtime must not hold ownership or a PostgreSQL transaction across a TigerBeetle call.

Therefore:

```text
runtime adoption:       optional globally
category declaration:   may require runtime semantics
adapter selection:      replaceable
celld:                   experimental candidate, not mandatory
```

Disabling or changing a category's runtime requirement is a reviewed category-level change. It must
not be introduced as an incidental fallback after an adapter failure.

## Entity Lifecycle

### 1. Resolve

The owning domain derives the deterministic address. The runtime resolves the current owner or
begins ownership acquisition.

### 2. Activate

The owner loads runtime state. Rebuildable state may load a checkpoint and then catch up from the
canonical owner: PostgreSQL for control-plane facts or the approved financial-ledger reconciliation
anchor for TigerBeetle-backed facts. Runtime-durable state may restore through the adapter, but it
must still verify its canonical version where business facts are involved.

### 3. Reconcile

Before accepting an invariant-sensitive command, the entity verifies that its runtime version is
compatible with the relevant canonical owner. A stale entity catches up, rebuilds, or fails closed;
it never overwrites a newer canonical version.

### 4. Execute

Commands for one address enter the entity's serialization boundary. Domain logic validates the
transition. Canonical effects execute through the owning public domain service and its approved
PostgreSQL or financial-ledger protocol.

### 5. Commit and project

The owning canonical protocol establishes success: PostgreSQL commit for PostgreSQL-owned facts,
or durable TigerBeetle acceptance plus the required PostgreSQL receipt for financial facts. The
runtime then advances its projection or marks it for catch-up. Transactional events and outbox
records follow the protocol in [`financial-ledger.md`](./financial-ledger.md) when applicable.

### 6. Idle and hibernate

An inactive entity may release memory or durable ownership according to the adapter. Important
in-memory data must already exist in runtime-durable storage or be rebuildable.

### 7. Reactivate or move

A new owner restores or rebuilds state, validates fencing and versions, and only then resumes
command processing.

## Ownership and Serialization

One logical owner means one current serialization authority for an entity address. It does not mean:

- one global runtime owner;
- one owner for an entire tenant;
- one database transaction across several entities;
- automatic ordering across different addresses;
- permission to remove PostgreSQL constraints;
- permission to trust an unfenced runtime owner after lease loss.

Independent addresses should execute concurrently. Entity granularity must be small enough to avoid
tenant-wide bottlenecks and large enough to preserve a real domain invariant.

## Cross-Entity Work

Synchronous entity-to-entity call chains must remain short and explicit. Do not create a remotely
traversable object graph.

Choose the existing semantic primitive:

```text
one local invariant
-> one entity command and one domain transaction

cross-domain invariant that must commit together
-> explicit shared PostgreSQL transaction context when supported

TigerBeetle-backed financial invariant
-> FinancialLedgerPort plus durable intent/outcome/reconciliation

committed fact and fan-out
-> PgQue event

leased or scheduled work
-> job table

checkpointed multi-step process
-> approved durable workflow / Process Studio runtime
```

Stateful entities simplify local ownership; they do not create distributed transactions.

## Runtime State

Runtime state may contain:

- current active state machine position;
- a rebuildable hot projection;
- the last reconciled canonical version;
- recent idempotency outcomes within a bounded window;
- object-local timer intent;
- active connection metadata;
- non-canonical coordination state.

It must not silently become the only copy of canonical journal metadata, payment, inventory movement,
legal document, authorization, or audit facts. It must not become a second authority for accepted
TigerBeetle transfers, balances, or transfer history.

Detailed consistency rules are owned by [`state-and-consistency.md`](./state-and-consistency.md).

## Recovery

Every entity category declares one recovery mode:

| Mode            | Recovery                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rebuildable     | Recompute from the relevant canonical facts and optional checkpoint |
| Runtime-durable | Restore adapter state, then verify/catch up against the canonical owner |
| Ephemeral       | Discard and recreate without business loss                     |
| Canonical       | Forbidden by default; requires a separate ownership ADR        |

Recovery must be bounded and observable. If rebuilding one entity requires an unbounded global scan,
the entity design or canonical projection is incomplete.

## Security

- Entity addresses are untrusted routing inputs and must be decoded and scoped.
- Authentication and authorization remain outside adapter ownership.
- Runtime infrastructure is not a tenant-security boundary.
- Plugins invoke public domain contracts, never runtime or adapter internals.
- Runtime snapshots, traces, and diagnostics follow the same tenant and sensitive data handling
  rules as canonical services.
- Adapter credentials and topology remain infrastructure secrets.

## Observability

The runtime must expose technical and domain-correlated telemetry.

Required technical dimensions:

```text
entity_type
hashed_or_redacted_entity_address
adapter
owner_node
ownership_epoch_or_fence
activation_reason
runtime_version
canonical_version
command_type
command_id
correlation_id
causation_id
tenant_id where policy permits
```

Required metrics include:

- command queue depth and wait time per entity type;
- command latency and failure rate;
- activation, restoration, and reconciliation latency;
- ownership acquisition, loss, movement, and fencing failures;
- resident, idle, hibernated, rebuilding, and failed entities;
- runtime/canonical version divergence;
- duplicate command rate and idempotency hits;
- PostgreSQL transactions, reads, retries, and lock waits for enabled workloads;
- adapter resource pressure and shedding;
- queue or outbox lag caused by entity commands.

Raw business identifiers and payloads must not be placed in high-cardinality metrics. Traces and
logs require redaction and retention policy.

## Adoption Workflow

For each proposed entity category:

1. document the invariant and current contention or coordination problem;
2. benchmark the existing direct-PostgreSQL path;
3. define the address, state class, version, command ID, and recovery path;
4. implement a local adapter and deterministic tests;
5. run failure-injection and reconciliation tests;
6. evaluate a distributed adapter behind the same contract;
7. compare correctness, latency, database load, and operating cost;
8. activate only through a category-specific reviewed configuration or ADR.

No category is enabled because another ERP object uses a similar name or because a table is large.
