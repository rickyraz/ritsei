ADRs preserve the decisions and trade-offs that were accepted at a point in time. This map explains
how related decisions fit together without rewriting their historical text. ADR-0074 is the current
accessible-primitive selection; ADR-0056 remains the historical design-system decision for its other
active boundaries. ADR-0075 is the current dependency-ownership boundary for workspace members.
ADR-0076 is the current typography direction and semantic text-style boundary.
ADR-0077 is the current semantic iconography and provider-adapter boundary.
ADR-0078 is the current motion ownership and runtime-wrapper boundary.
ADR-0079 is the current dnd-kit/Solid 2 activation gate and blocked-state boundary.
ADR-0080 is the current Solid-native Boneyard skeleton boundary.
ADR-0081 is the proposed renderer-independent Document AST and document-rendering platform boundary.
ADR-0082 is the current SAP-separated Communication Platform and Activity Timeline projection boundary.
ADR-0084 is a proposed cross-cutting progressive trust model; it is not an active canonical rule until accepted.
ADR-0085 is the current frontend public-contract refinement: TanStack adapters stay internal and semantic UI stays public. ADR-0086 is the current production implementation boundary for the native Solid 2 × Effect bridge.

    |
    +--> ADR-0082  SAP-separated Communication Platform boundaries
              +--> domain facts enter the transactional outbox; application communication policy derives intents
              +--> explicit user/process requests may create intents directly
              +--> recipients, contexts, templates, artifacts, and attempts stay separate
              +--> Activity Timeline is a rebuildable projection, not a `chatter_messages` authority

    |
    +--> ADR-0075  Dependency ownership follows application boundaries
              +--> root package.json owns repository-wide dependencies and tooling

              +--> Product Patterns and Visual Grammar become canonical
              |
              +--> ADR-0074 selects Kobalte for the Solid 2 primitive boundary
              |
              +--> ADR-0076 adopts Pretendard for product UI, IBM Plex Mono for technical values,
              |           and semantic typography tokens with a future Söhne brand layer

              +--> ADR-0078 adopts PandaCSS-first motion with Motion for runtime spatial behavior
              |

              +--> ADR-0057 layered TanStack frontend engine boundaries
                        +--> Query is selective server-state cache policy
                        +--> Table, Virtual, and Form are headless ERP engines
                        +--> Pacer is optional; DB remains research-only
              |
              +--> ADR-0085 separates internal TanStack adapters from public semantic UI
                        +--> DataTable/Form and semantic fields are public contracts
                        +--> query and virtualizer adapters are policy-owned and internal
              |
              +--> ADR-0072 native Solid 2 and Effect integration
                        +--> Solid owns the default reactive graph and ownership tree
                        +--> Solid Context carries the scoped Effect ManagedRuntime and `R`
                        +--> Effect Atom is opt-in for shared or portable reactive graphs
                                  +--> ADR-0086 promotes the bridge to `apps/web/src/shared/solid-effect.ts`
                                      and keeps the experiment as a re-exporting evidence harness
              |
              +--> ADR-0069 cartographic enterprise visual grammar
                        +--> HTML owns semantics and interaction
                        +--> WebGPU is optional and fallback-first
                        +--> material ratios are art direction, not a page template
                        +--> ADR-0070 selects vgpu behind a RITSEI renderer adapter
                                  +--> TypeGPU is deferred for future GPU-compute workloads
                        +--> ADR-0071 adopts seven universal cartographic archetypes
                                  +--> deterministic variation and semantic depth

ADR-0030  UserAccount lifecycle and tenant membership
    |
    +--> ADR-0058 provider-neutral identity and authentication boundary
              +--> selected IdentityProvider owns provider identity, credentials, and sessions
              +--> ZITADEL is recommended, not required
              +--> RITSEI owns UserAccount mapping and tenant membership
              +--> provider claims never become ERP capabilities

ADR-0006  Scoped capability authorization
    |
    +--> ADR-0059 replaceable RelationshipEngine
              +--> native PostgreSQL is the default implementation
              +--> SpiceDB is an optional high-scale adapter
              +--> RITSEI/PostgreSQL remains canonical AuthZ authority
              +--> permission matrix remains the coarse gate

    |
    +--> ADR-0084  Proposed explicit progressive trust boundaries
              +--> external representations gain no RITSEI identity, authority, or business fact by default
              +--> runtime decoding, identity, authorization, domain, and resource boundaries remain explicit
              +--> intent and commands cannot bypass owner-controlled deterministic execution

ADR-0034  Non-interference overload isolation
    |
    +--> ADR-0083 source-of-truth and derived-capability non-interference
              +--> Class A source-of-truth paths do not depend on unrelated Class B/C capabilities
              +--> committed facts and outbox records precede derived work
              +--> derived failures, retries, resources, and rebuilds remain local
              +--> ADR-0034 remains the detailed workload/resource proof owner
    |
    +--> ADR-0067 logical database and physical data placement
              +--> semantic ownership remains independent of placement

ADR-0001  Modular monolith
    |
    +--> ADR-0068 foundation, modules, platform, and runtime taxonomy
              +--> generic contracts live in foundation

              +--> composition roots live in runtime

ADR-0046  Owner-local business surface + generated structural ergonomics
    |
    +--> concrete business objects remain owner-local
    +--> ordinary structural changes may use reviewed CRUD-like helpers
    +--> meaningful transitions use explicit actions
    +--> consequential facts remain with their semantic owner
    +--> generated tooling is not business authority
              |
              +--> ADR-0047  Procurement Goods Receipt boundary
```

ADR-0046 amends the current architectural interpretation of ADR-0015 and ADR-0036. ADR-0047
amends the receipt and cancellation boundary of ADR-0044 and ADR-0045. ADR-0056 historically amended only the
frontend primitive and styling selection recorded by ADR-0010; ADR-0074 now supersedes its
accessible-primitive selection while retaining its Panda and Product Pattern boundaries. ADR-0057 clarifies the role and
adoption scope of the TanStack frontend engines; ADR-0072 defines the native Solid 2 and Effect
integration boundary without rejecting optional Atom use; ADR-0086 promotes that bridge's
implementation to the production frontend boundary; ADR-0058 amends only the authentication/session
provider boundary in ADR-0030; ADR-0059 defines the replaceable RelationshipEngine boundary in
ADR-0006; ADR-0070 concretizes the optional cartographic renderer selected by ADR-0069 without
changing its HTML-first, fallback-first semantics; and ADR-0071 replaces coarse industry categories
with seven universal cartographic archetypes, context-aware semantic mappings, deterministic
variation, and semantic depth. ADR-0073 supersedes the custom-checker selection portion of ADR-0062;
ADR-0075 supersedes the dependency-manifest ownership portion of ADR-0050 while retaining package.json
and deno.lock-based resolution; it deliberately defers a root catalog until multiple workspace members
share a version invariant. ADR-0076 amends the typography direction in ADR-0056 without changing
its Panda styling boundary. ADR-0077 amends the iconography direction in ADR-0056 while preserving
its provider-neutral design-system boundary. ADR-0078 amends the motion direction in ADR-0056 while
preserving Solid state ownership and Kobalte accessibility ownership. ADR-0079 records the dnd-kit
provider target but blocks activation until its Solid 2 compatibility evidence passes. ADR-0080
records Boneyard as a static geometry provider behind a Solid-native RITSEI Skeleton boundary while
ADR-0072 remains the reactive ownership authority. Fallow and ast-grep remain the generic enforcement owners while only
path-sensitive RITSEI checks remain custom. Both providers remain optional adapters; the RITSEI
contracts and authority remain active. The rest of those decisions remains active. None of these
amendments rewrite historical decisions, and ADR-0047 does not change the financial authority recorded
by ADR-0040.

## Proposed direction

ADR-0081 is intentionally not included in the active canonical rules below. Until its validation gates
pass, it is a proposed platform boundary: no renderer dependency, generic document authority, or
production rendering route is activated. ADR-0082 is active as a boundary decision, but its production
provider, persistence, worker, and campaign activation gates remain open. ADR-0084 remains proposed;
its progressive trust model does not replace the existing active subsystem rules until accepted.

## Current canonical rules

The current architecture is summarized here for navigation; the canonical rule remains in
[`architecture-spec-v4.md`](../architecture/architecture-spec-v4.md) and the owning ADRs.

- Business objects and documents are owner-local.
- Ordinary structural changes may be CRUD-like only within owner-approved fields and policy.
- Meaningful business transitions use explicit, typed, authorized actions.
- Cross-domain consequences use public contracts and approved transaction protocols.
- Movement, posting, settlement, and other facts remain owned by their semantic capabilities.
- Generated schemas, DTOs, queries, forms, CRUD helpers, and test skeletons are tooling, not business authority.
- Persistence models, ORM hooks, provider types, and private repositories do not become public domain contracts.
- External standards remain behind versioned adapters.
- The selected IdentityProvider authenticates principals; it does not grant ERP authority.
- ZITADEL is the recommended IdentityProvider adapter, not a required dependency.
- RITSEI Authorization owns capability, scope, relationship coordination, SoD, and decision evidence.
- Native PostgreSQL is the default RelationshipEngine; SpiceDB is an optional adapter, not a source of truth.
- Goods Receipt evidence belongs to Procurement; physical receipt movement belongs to Inventory.
- The logical database contract hides PostgreSQL placement; physical data topology remains infrastructure, not domain semantics.
- Foundation contains generic contracts, modules contain business capabilities, platform contains concrete adapters, and runtime contains composition roots.
- Communication is intent-driven and provider-independent; email is a channel, delivery attempts are not business facts, and Activity Timeline is a rebuildable projection over separate owners.
- Class A source-of-truth reads and writes do not synchronously depend on unrelated Class B operational or Class C UX/analytical capabilities; committed facts and outbox records precede derived work.
- Solid owns the default frontend reactive graph and ownership tree; Effect `R` is carried by scoped Solid Context runtimes, while Atom is an explicit shared/portable opt-in.
- Cartographic is a grammar for structure, relationship, pressure, movement, boundary, and state—not a requirement for topographic maps on every page.
- The seven visual archetypes are Stock, Flow, Capacity, Value, Relationship, Progress, and Asset / Space; industries compose them rather than receiving separate visual themes.
- Material variation is deterministic and context-aware; semantic depth complements, but never replaces, semantic HTML, labels, contrast, or accessible alternatives.
- Typography uses a small 12–32px scale, 400/500/600 weights, tabular numerals, and semantic text styles rather than arbitrary component values.
- Iconography uses semantic names, Regular/Fill/Duotone variants, controlled 14–32px sizes, and a replaceable provider adapter.
- Motion is PandaCSS-first, runtime-only for geometry or physics, reduced-motion aware, and never a source of business truth.
- dnd-kit is the target direct-manipulation provider, but remains not activated until a Solid 2-compatible build and browser gate pass.
- Skeleton visibility and lifecycle remain Solid-owned; Boneyard is a static geometry/artifact provider and never a reactive or service owner.

## Historical integrity

Do not rewrite an accepted ADR to make it describe the current state. When the direction changes,
create a new ADR, state whether it amends or supersedes earlier decisions, update the canonical
architecture, and update this map. Historical ADR text remains the record of the earlier decision.
