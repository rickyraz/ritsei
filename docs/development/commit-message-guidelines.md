## Policy

RITSEI uses a type-first [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
format with an optional subsystem/package scope. This is RITSEI’s hybrid convention:
the type stays first for changelog and release tooling, while the scope provides
package-level navigation. It also follows the concise, imperative, focused-history
practices documented by
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project)
and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-open-source).
“Silicon Valley standard” is not a formal authority; this is RITSEI’s explicit
repository standard.

## Format

```text
<type>(<optional-scope>)!: <imperative summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

Use one of these types:

| Type | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | A new capability |
| `fix` | A bug or incorrect behavior |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor` | Internal restructuring without behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `test` | Test changes |
| `build` | Build system or dependency changes |
| `ci` | Continuous-integration changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance that does not fit another type |
| `style` | Formatting or non-semantic style changes |
| `revert` | Reverting an earlier commit |

## Rules

- Keep each commit to one logical change; do not mix unrelated refactors or
  formatting.
- Write the summary in lowercase, imperative present tense, without a period:
  `docs: define the commit message standard`.
- Keep the summary concise: target 50 characters and do not exceed 72 characters
  unless the scope is necessary for clarity.
- If a body is needed, separate it with one blank line, wrap lines at 72
  characters, and explain the motivation, important constraints, or migration
  impact.
- Use a scope only when it adds useful package or subsystem context, such as
  `accounting`, `inventory`, `kernel`, or `docs`.
- Mark an incompatible change with `!` after the type or scope and explain it in
  a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Do not rewrite shared or already-published history without explicit approval.

## Examples

```text
feat(inventory): add idempotent stock correction

fix(accounting): reject blank operation identities

docs: clarify transaction rollback evidence

refactor(kernel)!: replace the database client port

BREAKING CHANGE: callers must provide the new transaction capability.
```
