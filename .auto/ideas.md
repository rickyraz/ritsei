# Deferred ideas

- Add a first Business Fact Contract only when one measured dashboard needs it.
- Evaluate ClickHouse or Pinot only after PostgreSQL projection limits are measured.
- Evaluate Iceberg only for proven retention, open-table, or multi-engine requirements.
- Evaluate DuckDB only as a bounded worker/export execution engine with resource and extension controls.
- Add cross-engine golden-data conformance only when a second analytic provider is activated.
- Create a self-observation ADR only when a measured evaluator use case defines finding ownership,
  evidence, review, persistence, and bounded action policy.
- Enforce Procurement `SupplierAccount` eligibility at the database boundary: reject same-tenant
  customer or inactive Party relationships while preserving the existing cross-tenant foreign-key
  path; the trigger candidate passed all checks but was deferred because the Level 3 metric is already
  at its six-domain ceiling.
