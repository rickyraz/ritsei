name: create-domain-module
description: "Use when adding a new packages/<domain> capability, assigning a new schema owner, or when a request says to create a domain such as supplier contracts, fulfillment, settlement, or evidence."
---

# Purpose

Create the smallest RITSEI domain package with explicit semantic ownership, a public Effect contract, protected persistence, and enforceable boundaries.

# Use This Skill When

- adding a new directory under `packages/`;
- introducing a new authoritative business capability or PostgreSQL schema owner;
- a traditional feature must be split into an orthogonal capability;
- the request says “add a domain/module for …”.

# Do Not Use This Skill When

- extending an existing owner; use the relevant schema, contract, API, or transaction skill;
- adding a frontend feature or external adapter without a new domain owner;
- ownership is still ambiguous.

# Required Context

Inspect first:

- the closest implemented package, usually [`packages/party`](../../../packages/party/mod.ts), [`packages/inventory`](../../../packages/inventory/mod.ts), or [`packages/accounting`](../../../packages/accounting/mod.ts);
- [`db/ownership.toml`](../../../db/ownership.toml);
- the semantic-owner and module-contract rules in the canonical architecture;
- related ADRs and the affected composite process.

# Architecture Rules

- One business invariant has one authoritative domain owner.
- Other packages import only the new package’s `mod.ts` public contract.
- Public exports may contain commands, queries, Effect services, tagged errors, Effect Schema DTOs, and layers—not Drizzle tables or repositories.
- A package may import only its owned persistence tables.
- Dependencies must remain acyclic.
- Do not add empty factories, generic repositories, or speculative extension points.

# Workflow

## 1. Inspect

Find the nearest domain implementation and its contract tests. Identify existing owners for every fact the proposed package touches.

## 2. Decide

Record the capability’s responsibility, owned facts, invariants, public operations, failures, dependencies, and whether it truly needs a schema, capability, API endpoint, event, or worker.

If this changes a difficult-to-reverse boundary or source of truth, create an ADR before implementation.

## 3. Implement

Create only the files required now:

```text
packages/<domain>/mod.ts
packages/<domain>/src/...
packages/<domain>/tests/...
```

If persistence is required, compose with `change-owned-schema`. If another domain must consume it, compose with `expose-public-contract` and `introduce-cross-domain-integration`. Add API and authorization surfaces only when requested.

## 4. Validate

Run focused contract tests first, then repository policy checks.

# Deterministic Tools

```sh
deno task skills:check
deno task boundary:test
deno task boundary:lint
deno task check:affected
deno task check
```

Use `deno task db:generate` and `deno task db:check` only when the domain owns persistence changes. No domain scaffolding generator exists; copying semantic boilerplate would hide decisions that must be made explicitly.

# Required Checks

- public tests import only `packages/<domain>/mod.ts`;
- ownership registry and migration checks pass when persistence is added;
- package dependency graph remains acyclic;
- every public tagged failure and authorization path is tested;
- documentation or ADRs are updated only at their canonical owner.

# Failure Conditions

Stop and report instead of guessing when:

- two domains plausibly own the same invariant;
- the design requires direct writes to another domain’s tables;
- a dependency cycle appears;
- cross-domain atomicity requires a transaction-aware contract that does not exist;
- the requested module is only a speculative placeholder.

# Completion Criteria

The package has one clear responsibility, an explicit public entry point, no leaked persistence types, the minimum required tests, registered ownership where applicable, and all deterministic checks pass.
